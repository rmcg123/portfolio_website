  <h1>
    An analysis of Eirgrid electricity data
  </h1>

  <p>
    Ireland's electricity transmission system operator Eirgrid has a set of
    <a href="https://www.smartgriddashboard.com/">data dashboards</a>
    available that display various information from the electricity grid. The
    information available includes things like electricity supply and demand,
    the amount of electricity generated by wind energy and the net flow on Ireland's
    interconnectors among other data. By inspecting
    the HTTP requests that these dashboards make I determined where the data was
    being pulled in from and proceeded to send some requests for myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most of the data areas there is historical data available for the previous
    several years at 15 minute intervals. I wrote some code to request all data
    available for some of the provided information streams for the last 5 years.
    I collected the retrieved data into PySpark dataframes and then did some
    analysis on the distribution of each statistic over various time slices
    (hourly, monthly, yearly). This is my first attempt at using PySpark and my
    initial impression is that the syntax is a bit clunky (in comparison with pandas).

  <p>
    In the panel of boxplots above we are comparing the distributions of electricity
    demand (left column) to those of electricity generation (right column) split
    by hour (top row), month (middle row) and year (bottom row). We can see the variation
    in hourly demand and generation where the highest medians occur between 17-20 hours period.
    We can also see the monthly variation of electricity demand and generation with
    larger demand in the winter months. The most obvious mismatch in demand and
    generation occurs in year 2023 where the median demand is above 4.5 GW while
    the median generation is only just above 4 GW. This shortfall is made up with net
    interconnector inflows of electricity (The electricity grid on the island of Ireland currently
    has two 500MW interconnectors with the British electricity grid).

  <p>
    We can also look at the wind generation and CO2 intensity of the electricity produced:
  </p>

  <img src="{% static 'eirgrid_analysis/wind_generation/month.png' %}" style="width:80%">
  <img src="{% static 'eirgrid_analysis/co2_intensity/month.png' %}" style="width:80%">

  <p>
    In the two figures above we are looking at the distributions of the electricity
    generated from wind split by month and the CO2 intensities by month.
    In the first of these plots we can see that there is, unsurprisingly, less
    wind energy produced in the April-September period compared to the October-March
    period. We can see this partly translate into lower CO2 intensity of electricity
    during the windier months in the second plot.
  </p>

  <img src="{% static 'eirgrid_analysis/co2_intensity/year.png' %}" style="width:80%">

  <p>
    In the plot above we can see the distribution of CO2 intensities by year
    with 2023 having a considerably lower median CO2 intensity than previous
    years.

    If you are interested in seeing how this was done the code for this
        project is available on my GitHub
