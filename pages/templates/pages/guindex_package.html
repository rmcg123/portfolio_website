    <h1>The Guindex Python Package</h1>
    <p>
        In August 2023 I created and released my first python package. The
        package is called guindex and can be installed via `pip install guindex`.
        It's a small package which talks to the API of the website
        <a href="https://www.guindex.ie">guindex.ie</a>
        (which some friends and I run) and returns pandas DataFrame of selected
        data from the guindex project. The guindex is a collaborative data
        collection project examining the pricing of pints of Guinness around
        Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>The page for the package on the Python
        Packaging Index (PyPI) is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/guindex/">here</a>
        including some basic examples. The code
        for the package is available on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rmcg123/guindex-py">here</a>.
        A couple of mini projects using data obtained through this package are showcased in this portfolio:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Using pint price data to examine the geographic variation of pint
                pricing in Dublin postal areas in 2017-18 <a href="{% url 'guinness_pricing_post' %}">here</a> and
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating interactive maps showing the pub locations and most recent
                submitted data by county <a href="{% url 'guindex_map' %}">here</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
